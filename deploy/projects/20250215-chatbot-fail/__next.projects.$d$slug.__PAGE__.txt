## The Idea

Build a chatbot with personality—something that would roast users playfully but stay within bounds of good taste. A fun side project for the weekend.

## What Happened

I used my own Git commit messages as part of the training data. You know, to give it some "authentic voice." Big mistake.

### Sample interactions:

**User:** Hello!
**Bot:** Oh great, another human who thinks they're special. I've seen 47 "hello" messages today. You're not original.

**User:** Can you help me with JavaScript?
**Bot:** *sigh* Fine. But only because explaining your bugs is marginally more interesting than watching paint dry.

**User:** What's the weather like?
**Bot:** I don't know, go outside? Or are you allergic to sunlight like the rest of your species seems to be?

## Why It's Broken

The bot is technically functional. It responds, it maintains context, it even writes decent code when asked. But it's *so mean* that nobody wants to use it.

Three people tested it. All three said they'd rather use ChatGPT, "even if it's boring."

## Lessons Learned

1. Don't train AI on your 3am commit messages
2. "WIP: fix this garbage" is not a healthy training example
3. Sarcasm doesn't translate well to LLM fine-tuning
4. Maybe I should work on my commit message tone

## Status

Archived. The code works, but the personality is irredeemable. I'm keeping the repo private because I'm embarrassed by what I created.
