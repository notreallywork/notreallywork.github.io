The API is RESTful, the database schema is normalized, the auth is secure. But it's a solution looking for a problem.\n\n## Lessons\n\n- Check if something exists before building it\n- \"For the learning experience\" is expensive at 3 weeks\n- Sometimes the best code is the code you delete\n\n## Status\n\nRepo is archived. I migrated everything to Markdown files and never looked back.\n"}]}],["$","footer",null,{"className":"mt-12 pt-6 border-t border-black","children":["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/projects/","className":"text-sm underline hover:no-underline","children":"← Back to all projects"}]}]]}],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/8fccb749a5dfa5ba.js","async":true}]],["$","$L4",null,{"children":["$","$5",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@6"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
