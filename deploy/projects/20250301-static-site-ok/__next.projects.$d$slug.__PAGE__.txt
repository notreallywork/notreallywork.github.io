## Overview

The site you're looking at right now. A brutalist, utilitarian archive built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript. No animations, no gradients, no nonsense.

## Features

- **Markdown-based content**: Projects and logs stored as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter
- **Auto-generated navigation**: Sidebar builds itself from content files
- **Static export**: Deployed as static HTML for maximum reliability
- **Zero client-side JavaScript**: (Okay, minimal JS for the mobile menu)

## Design Decisions

### Why brutalism?

Because everything else looks the same. Smooth gradients, rounded corners, subtle shadows—it's all starting to blur together. This site is intentionally jarring.

### Why no animations?

They break. Or they slow things down. Or they trigger motion sickness. Static is reliable.

### Why the red?

It's alarming. It draws attention to links and errors. It matches the feeling of seeing a production bug at 2am.

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript (strict mode) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Content | Markdown + gray-matter |
| Deployment | Vercel (static export) |

## What Works

- Content management via git
- Fast build times
- Perfect Lighthouse scores
- No dependencies on external APIs

## What's Next

Probably nothing. This site is "done" in the sense that it does what it needs to do. Any additional features would violate the principle of minimalism.

But I'll probably redesign it in 6 months anyway.
