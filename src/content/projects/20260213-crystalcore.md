summary: "Finally, a math game that doesn't feel like Saturday morning Kumon. Blast geometric Void shards into crystalline dust while hurtling through neon death tunnels—solve lightning-fast equations to recharge your weapon before you're stuck dodging bullets with an empty chamber. Built for two kids sharing an iPad where one counts blocks and the other calculates trajectories, and somehow both are winning. Adaptive AI stealth-adjusts the difficulty so nobody rage-quits. Warning: may cause voluntary multiplication practice."
