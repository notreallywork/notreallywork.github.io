## Stack
Next.js 14 + Tailwind + Markdown. Static export to GitHub Pages. Custom domain `notreally.work`.

## Concept
Corporate directory aesthetics hosting chaotic experiments. File permissions as UI. Amber phosphor on CRT black. Everything is monospace. Nothing is rounded.

## How it works
Markdown files in `src/content/projects/` define metadata. Built experiments live in `public/experiments/`. The site generates static pages at build time—no database, no CMS, just files.

Not a portfolio. An archive.
