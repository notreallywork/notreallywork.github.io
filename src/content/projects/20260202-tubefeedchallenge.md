summary: "Finally, a medical quiz that doesn't put you to sleep. Race against the clock to save virtual patients from nutrition disasters—drag feeding tubes to the right spot, sequence weaning protocols, and pray you don't trigger refeeding syndrome. Designed for massive touchscreens at medical conferences where healthcare professionals secretly compete to prove they're smarter than their colleagues. Warning: may cause unexpected learning."
