Site built in 120 minutes. Concept debated for 3 days.

## The stack

- **Concept:** ChatGPT (the "what if terminal aesthetic" prompt)
- **Refinement:** Claude (the brutalist architecture review)
- **Build:** Kimi (generated the actual Next.js files)
- **Troubleshooting:** All of the above, in parallel, across browser tabs

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Tool |
|-------|----------|------|
| Concept | 1 day | ChatGPT |
| Architecture | 4 hours | Claude |
| Actual coding | **15 min** | Kimi |
| Debugging | 4 hours | Trial & error |

## What actually happened

Friday night: "I should build a personal site."

Saturday morning: 47 messages with ChatGPT about "anti-work brutalist terminal aesthetic."

Saturday afternoon: Claude convinced me the directory listing approach was correct.

Saturday evening: Kimi generated the codebase while I watched.

Sunday morning: Fixed the `generateStaticParams` error (classic). And a whole bunch of rookie errors. 

Sunday afternoon: Live.

## The irony

The README took longer to write than the site. Just kidding, the README was also AI-generated (with direction).
